<img src="assets/cc/cc1.png" alt="campus creamery logo">



<h2 class="sectitle"> &lt Overview &gt </h2>
<p>The Campus Creamery rewards app was developed as a team project in collaboration with Google Developer Groups (GDG) to bring WashUâ€™s late-night
     dessert experience at Campus Creamery to a mobile platform. Designed as a digital menu and loyalty rewards app, it enables students to browse offerings,
     log in securely, and earn points for rewards. The app features a fun, space-themed interface and integrates Firebase for authentication and real-time data management.</p>

<h2 class="sectitle"> &lt Project Goals &gt </h2>
<ul>
    <li>Provide an engaging, mobile-first experience for accessing menu items.</li>
    <li>Enable secure student login via Firebase Authentication.</li>
    <li>Lay the groundwork for a loyalty system to increase customer retention.</li>
    <li>Maintain consistent theming and usability across screens.</li>
    <li>Leverage real-time backend services for a dynamic experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="sectitle"> &lt Tech Stack &gt </h2>
<h3>Frontend</h3>
<ul>
    <li>React Native (TypeScript): Core mobile framework</li>
    <li>Expo: Used for development and deployment</li>
    <li>Firebase Authentication: Handles user sign-up/login</li>
</ul>
<h3>Backend</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Node.js + Express.js: Backend server and API handling</li>
    <li>Firebase Admin SDK: Secure backend access to Firebase</li>
    <li>Firestore: Stores menu items, users, and event data</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="sectitle"> &lt Key Features &gt </h2>

<div>
    <h4>Authentication System</h4>
    <p>The app includes a secure authentication system using Firebase, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts. 
        Firebase Authentication handles session management and ensures smooth, protected access to user-specific data.
</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h4>Menu Page </h4>
    <p>The Menu Page displays real-time data by connecting directly to Firestore, allowing users to browse up-to-date menu items and categories.
         Any changes made in the database are instantly reflected in the app without needing a refresh.
</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h4>Profile Page</h4>
    <p>The Profile Page allows users to view and manage their account information in a clean, intuitive layout. It serves as a hub for user 
        settings and, loyalty rewards tracking.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h4>Loyalty Rewards System</h4>
    <p>A fully designed Rewards section featured point-earning logic, a visual progress tracker, and a tiered rewards model to incentivize repeat
         engagement. Although this system was not fully  implemented in the final build, it was created to support user retention through gamified incentives.
</p>
</div>

<h2 class="sectitle"> &lt My Contributions &gt </h2>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>As a co-UI/UX designer and frontend developer on this GDG team project, I was responsible for both visual design and implementation. I created high-fidelity 
    designs for the Home Page Navigation Bar, Menu Page, and Profile/Login Page, ensuring a consistent and engaging space-themed experience throughout the app. I also 
    designed a detailed Rewards section for the Profile page, which included a point tracking system, a reward redemption interface, and a tiered rewards model to encourage repeat engagement.
     Although this Rewards section was fully designed, it was not implemented in the final version of the app.
</p>
<h3>Development and Collaboration</h3>
<p>On the development side, I coded the Menu Page using React Native with TypeScript, pulling dynamic content from Firestore and styling the components for usability and visual cohesion. Throughout the project, I actively participated in team discussions, sprint planning, and code reviews, contributing to a collaborative and iterative development process.
